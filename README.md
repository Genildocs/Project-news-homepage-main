## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

<i>Hello, this was my solution for the "News homepage" challenge. I used CSS grid in conjunction with flex-box for item alignment. I tried to use the "BEM" methodology for block organization and used the SASS preprocessor. Feedback and tips are welcome.Responsive menu was implemented using JavaScript.</i>
